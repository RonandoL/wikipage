      <h1>The Grid System</h1>
      <p>Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content.

      <ul>
        <li>They increase productivity by providing simple and predictable layout scaffolding to HTML design. The structure of a page can be formulated quickly without second guessing its precision or cross-browser compatibility.</li>
        <li>They are versatile in how layouts can be constructed, being adaptable in varying combinations of rows and columns. They even support nested grids for more complex use cases. No matter your layout requirements, a grid system is almost certainly well suited.</li>
        <li>They are ideal for responsive layouts. This is where grid systems reign supreme. They make it incredibly easy to create mobile friendly interfaces that are adaptable to different sized viewports.</li>
      </ul>
